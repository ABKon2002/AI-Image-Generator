# AI - Image Generator

This repository contains the code for a web application that harnesses the power of AI to generate images using the OpenAI API. The backend, built with Node.js and Express, communicates with the OpenAI API to produce images based on user prompts, while the frontend, developed with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, presents these images to users.

## Features

- User-friendly interface to enter prompts.
- Integration with the OpenAI API to generate images.
- Display of generated images on the website.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have met the following requirements:

- Node.js and npm (Node Package Manager) installed on your system.
- An OpenAI API key for accessing the image generation service.
- 'nodemon' to run the code during development.

## Installation

1. Clone this repository to your local machine using the following command:
  `git clone https://github.com/ABKon2002/AI-Image-Generator.git`
2. Navigate to your project repo:
  `cd AI-Image-Generator`
3. Install the required npm packages:
   `npm install openai express`
4. Create a `.env` file in the root directory and add your OpenAI API key
5. Start the application. Its recomended to run the `index.html` file using 'nodemon' during development so that you dont have to keep refreshing after any changes in the code base.
